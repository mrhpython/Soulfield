| Companies House delays | Use formation agent (1st Formations) for same-day |
| Stripe Connect approval | Start with test mode, gather required docs parallel |
| GDPR non-compliance | Use pre-approved templates, explicit consent only |
| UK banking delays | Use Tide/Revolut Business for instant account |
| Consumer rights violations | Mandatory 14-day cooling-off period built-in |
