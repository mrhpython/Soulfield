1) UI Architecture & File Map
   - One-window layout (left nav or top tabs), primary panes, and component responsibilities.
   - Proposed folders/files for the GUI project (e.g., app shell, tabs, services, state), with 1-line purpose each.
2) Text Wireframes (ASCII)
   - For each tab (Projects, Sessions, Agents, Commands, Memory, Specs, Logs, Settings, MCP):
     * Layout zones (Header | Left Nav | Main | Right Pane).
     * Key components (lists/tables/editors/charts/buttons).
     * Primary actions (exact button labels).
     * Empty/loading/error states + 3â€“4 keyboard shortcuts.
3) API Contract (backend <-> GUI, localhost only)
   - METHOD, PATH, request JSON, response JSON, error shape for:
     * /api/research (topic)
