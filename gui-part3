   - Phase 2 (MVP): Commands tab calling API; Specs viewer/editor; Logs tail; Sessions list; basic Agents editor.
   - Phase 3 (Enhance): Session time travel (checkpoints/branch/diff), analytics dashboard, MCP panel, memory inspector/upsert, guardrails & confirmations.
   - For each task: goal, inputs/outputs, success criteria, risks/mitigations.

Non-functional requirements to honor
- Privacy/local-first (no telemetry), safety gates (manual confirm before apply), performance (fast startup), resilience (clear errors and retry), accessibility (keyboard nav), and TruthLens visibility (show passed/failed lens flags on relevant screens).

Acceptance Criteria
- Bullet list of observable behaviors the GUI must satisfy to be considered “done” for MVP.

Constraints
- Backend surface is the existing service and CLI; GUI calls local HTTP only.
- All Claude usage is via Aiden -> TruthLens; do not assume direct model access from the GUI.
- Keep deliverables implementation-agnostic, no code.
