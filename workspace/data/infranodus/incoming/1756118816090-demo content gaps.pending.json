    "## Overview",
    "Integration of GitHub agents repository as modular tools within existing backend architecture, enabling agent-as-tool paradigm with zone-aware orchestration and TruthLens compliance.",
    "## Current Repository Analysis",
    "- **wshobson/agents**: Appears to be a multi-agent framework with task orchestration capabilities",
    "- **Key Components**: Agent definitions, task routing, execution contexts",
    "- **Architecture Pattern**: Microservice-oriented with message passing",
    "## Integration Approaches",
    "### 1. Adapter Pattern Implementation",
    "- Create `backend/adapters/agents/` directory structure",
    "- Implement `AgentAdapter` base class for standardised agent wrapping",
    "- Each external agent becomes a tool via adapter interface",
    "- Maintain loose coupling with main system",
    "### 2. Tool Registry System",
    "- Extend `tools/` with agent registration mechanism",
    "- Dynamic agent discovery and loading",
    "- Metadata-driven capability mapping",
    "- Version control for agent specifications",
    "### 3. Manager Agent Architecture",
    "- Central orchestrator in `backend/adapters/agents/manager.py`",
    "- Handles agent lifecycle, routing, and zone compliance",
    "- Implements circuit breaker pattern for resilience",
    "- TruthLens validation at boundaries",
    "## Concrete Integration Ideas",
    "### CLI Integration",
    "```bash",
    "# Agent management commands",
    "agents list --zone=uk",
    "agents deploy <agent-name> --config=config.yaml",
    "agents test <agent-name> --input=test.json",
    "agents logs <agent-name> --tail=100",
    "```",
    "### Zone-Aware Implementation",
    "- Geographic routing based on data residency requirements",
    "- UK-first processing with fallback zones",
    "- Latency-based agent selection",
    "- Compliance metadata per zone",
    "### Logging Architecture",

    "│   ├── uk/",
    "│   └── global/",
    "└── truthlens/",
    "    └── validations/",
    "```",
    "### TruthLens Integration Points",
    "1. **Input Validation**: Verify agent inputs against TruthLens schemas",
    "2. **Output Sanitisation**: Ensure responses meet truth constraints",
    "3. **Audit Trail**: Complete lineage tracking for compliance",
    "4. **Fact Checking**: Cross-reference agent outputs with verified sources",
    "## Technical Considerations",
    "- Message queue for async agent communication",
    "- Redis for agent state management",
    "- Docker containers for agent isolation",
    "- API gateway for external agent access",
    "- Prometheus metrics for monitoring",
