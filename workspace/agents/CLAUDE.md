# CLAUDE.md — Project Context

- Use concise, bullet-heavy outputs.
- Prefer files over chat; write to `research/`, `specs/`, `product/`, or `knowledge/`.
- Assume TruthLens will wrap outputs server-side.
- For specs, include:
  - Intent & Acceptance Criteria
  - MVP (thin slice)
  - ≤12 tasks
  - Metrics for week 1
  - `## Run (approved)` with ONLY: echo | ls | cat | head

## Constraints (always apply)
- Online-first • UK-based context • Use GBP
- No dropshipping • No physical retail/in-person-only ops
- Marketplaces allowed only if UK-held stock & VAT compliant
