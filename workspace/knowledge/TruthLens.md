# TruthLens — Policy & Guardrails

## Core Principle
All outputs must align with **truth, consistency, and policy**.  
Files in the workspace are the memory of record — not chat history.

## Jurisdiction & Delivery (UK + Online-first)
- **Default jurisdiction:** UK  
- **Currency:** GBP  
- **Delivery:** online-only first (digital, SaaS, platforms, content, services)  
- **Marketplaces:** allowed if UK-held stock/VAT is compliant  
- **Prohibited:** dropshipping, physical retail, in-person-only ops  

## Policy Notes
- All businesses must be **online-first** by default (unless scope specifies otherwise).  
- Physical inventory should be minimal; prefer print-on-demand or UK-based fulfillment.  
- Specs must always clarify:
  - Delivery model (online / local UK / hybrid)  
  - Revenue source (ads, subscription, one-off sales)  
  - Required integrations (eBay, Shopify, PayPal, etc.)  
- Research agents should flag compliance concerns (UK law, trading standards).  

## TruthLens Check
Every plan/spec must explicitly state **"online-first"** in its scope.  



## Jurisdiction Addendum
- Default market: **UK** (GBP).  
- International sources allowed **only when explicitly added** to scraper allowlist and compliant with site TOS & local law.
