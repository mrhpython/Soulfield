# Daily Recap — Soulfield OS
_Date: $(date -Iseconds)_

## Work Completed
- ✅ Spec ingestion flow tested (InfraNodus → Soulfield → spec.md).
- ✅ CLI helper `sf` confirmed (dry, apply, log).
- ✅ Compliance policies integrated (legal docs, whitelist, policy YAML).
- ✅ UK Online Marketplace spec executed cleanly (green pass).
- ✅ Knowledge base seeded (UK-Online-Compliance.md).
- ✅ `legal/` folder populated with working policy docs.

## Observations
- Scraper remains gov-only for compliance, demand signals via APIs/Infra.
- Spec pipeline smooth: research → spec → compliance check → apply.

## Next Steps
- Add Bright Data/Jina integration hooks.
- Expand infra import/export workflows.
- Start ebay/market research spec (compliant route).
- Snapshot specs daily for clarity.
