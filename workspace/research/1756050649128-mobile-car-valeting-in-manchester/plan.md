- **Contingency**: £20

### Cost Controls
- Pause ads if CPC exceeds £2
- Use free Canva/tools wherever possible
- Buy supplies from Costco/wholesale only
- Barter services for testimonials initially

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk: Weather Disruption
**Mitigation**: Partner with 2 covered car parks for rainy day operations. Offer "Weather Guarantee" - free re-wash if rains within 24 hours.

### Risk: Competitor Price War
**Mitigation**: Focus on convenience and subscription model rather than one-off pricing. Bundle services for higher AOV.

### Risk: Quality Inconsistency
**Mitigation**: Create photo checklist for each service. Implement "Not Happy? Don't Pay" guarantee for first 50 customers.

### Risk: Demand Exceeding Capacity
**Mitigation**: Pre-identify 2 freelance valeters for overflow. Cap daily bookings at 8 until process optimized.

### Risk: Low Digital Adoption
**Mitigation**: Enable phone bookings via dedicated number. Print QR code flyers for older demographics. Partner with local shops as booking points.

### Risk: Insurance/Legal Issues
**Mitigation**: Secure public liability insurance Day 1 (£30/month). Use customer's water/power initially. Clear T&Cs on all bookings.
